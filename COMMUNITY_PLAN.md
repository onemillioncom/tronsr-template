Adaptation of the TRON network in Europe is slow and arduous. We are currently observing a noticeable lack of a leader who will take specific action to promote the TRON blockchain. As OneMillion, we want to become a TRON ambassador in Europe.

We plan to show the greatest number of people in Europe the benefits of using this network and its competitive advantage. Each subsequent project that asks us for help with business tokenization brings us closer to this goal. In addition, we use TRON cryptocurrency on all ecosystem platforms, as well as blockchain itself.
