For many years we have been acquiring knowledge about blockchain technology, looking for the best solutions, and implementing them in our project. We believe that the TRON network gives us great opportunities, which is why we decided to support this project. We strive to be a Super Representative, and our goal is to promote and adopt TRON blockchain in Europe. With our help, more and more projects based on this network are created.
We have 3 proprietary platforms in which we use the TRX cryptocurrency and our own MONx token, built on the TRON network.

# OneMillion - The use of cryptocurrencies in everyday life

The OneMillion project brings together many platforms that create a comprehensive ecosystem within which the user has the opportunity to:


- Buy and sell cryptocurrencies
- Exchange cryptocurrencies for goods and services
- Acquire knowledge about blockchain technology and its legal aspects
- Automate trading on the cryptocurrency market
- Buy cheaper thanks to the affiliate program
- Stokenize your business using the TRON network


We've also created our proprietary MONx token, whose value is based on usability on all OneMillion project platforms. Our users and investors can use the token itself.


We use TRON technology in all our platforms and implement it in other companies as part of the tokenization service. In recent months, a lot of companies wanting to tokenize their business come to us, we recommend the TRON network to each of them. We consider ourselves TRON network ambassadors in Europe.

# Our platforms:

- OneMillionShop
Marketplace where cryptocurrencies are used to pay for goods and services. TRX is one of them. We use our payment processor on the site, thanks to which customers pay for purchases in the cryptocurrency and sellers receive traditional currencies, without exchange rate risk.

We plan to enable holders of our MONx token to receive a percentage of the platform's profit by freezing tokens. We want to do it in a TRON sweetheart as DAAP.




- OneMillion Coupons
The platform is used to distribute MONx tokens; to the affiliate program; selling the Tokenization service; internal stock exchange. In the future, it will be used to distribute OneMillionShop revenue dividends to users.

- AT.Systems
Automatic trading software on the cryptocurrency market, access to which can be purchased by paying with MONx tokens.
