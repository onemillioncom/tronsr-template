We plan to expand our efforts to adopt the TRON network in Europe thanks to the funds raised in the voting process. Increased online marketing activities, participation in industry events throughout Europe, and the adaptation of the throne network in newer and newer projects are just part of the activities we plan.

Our strategy is to distribute 80% of the prize between voters
