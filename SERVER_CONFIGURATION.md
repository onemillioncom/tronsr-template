Our Data Center is dispersed between the prices of independent suppliers OVH Cloud and Amazon AWS, and the mirroring of the products is physically mapped in the OneMillion server room, where we conduct initial product tests, thus obtaining production-friendly environments. Access to management of the mentioned environments takes place with the use of VPN.
